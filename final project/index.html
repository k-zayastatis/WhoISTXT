                1st Full-Length Album <br>
                This album tells a story of the "magical adventures" that the members as boys who are different, but 
                alike, experience together during their transition to adolescence.

        <div class="fullalbumtext"><span class="medalbumtext">  THE CHAOS CHAPTER: FREEZE</span> <br><br>
                Following The Dream Chapter, the dreams are swept away by the reality of the world. Their peaceful lives are disrupted 
                and their world falls apart leaving the members feeling insignificant, empty, and frozen. 
                What helps them out of this slump is 'you' as with 'you' they experience love and believe 'you' are 
                their only real world.

                This album tells a story of the youth who had been delaying adulthood and escaping from their world but finally decide
                to face reality. Facing reality feels like they are freefalling as reality torments them, but with determination they 
                continue their journey and face everything that comes their way.
